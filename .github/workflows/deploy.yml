# Edit and add other trigger options if an extra new Web deployment is needed.
# Generally I only need a new deployment when I publish a new release, but I may want to trigger it on defaults:
# prerelease or just an edit sometimes to test the workflow or a new build irl, these trigger types can be used then:
